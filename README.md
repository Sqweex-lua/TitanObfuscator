# TITAN OBFUSCATOR v 0.0.1 Release

TITAN OBFUSCATOR is a professional Java bytecode-level source code protection tool. It focuses on breaking decompiler logic and making manual analysis nearly impossible through extreme visual and logical obfuscation.

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sqweex-lua/TitanObfuscator.git
cd titan-obfuscator
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the obfuscator by providing your Java file:
Bash

python titan.py MyScript.java

The output will be a randomized Java file (e.g., lI1O0lIlI.java) containing the protected code.

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

The author is not responsible for any misuse. Always ensure you have the rights to the code you are obfuscating.
